# Advent of code

My take on the Advent of code challenge.

The general rules that I will follow are,
```
1. Every new puzzle must be solved using a previously unused programming language.Â 
2. The solution to a challenge must be completed and uploaded before 23:59 on the day of release.
3. Each solution must be able to take a user input in the form of a file to solve.
```
## What is advent of code?
```
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill 
levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, 
a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
